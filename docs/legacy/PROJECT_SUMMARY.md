## Implementation Status

### âœ… All Features Complete

- [x] **Browser Management** - Playwright integration with headed/headless modes
- [x] **Node Extraction** - Selector fallback chain with scroll sweep
- [x] **Hierarchy Inference** - Geometry-based category/subcategory detection
- [x] **Drawer Extraction** - Topic, description, and resources extraction
- [x] **CSV Export** - UTF-8 encoded with proper schema
- [x] **CLI Interface** - Full-featured command-line tool
- [x] **Error Handling** - Graceful failures with partial results
- [x] **Progress Logging** - Detailed progress and success rate reporting

### âœ… All Acceptance Criteria Met

1. âœ… **Technology Stack**: Python-based solution
2. âœ… **Delivery Format**: MVP released as CLI tool
3. âœ… **Data Extraction**: Complete roadmap structure
   - Hierarchical categories and subcategories
   - Topic names and descriptions
   - Resource links
4. âœ… **Output Format**: CSV export
5. âœ… **Reliability**: Handles client-rendered content

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Use setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Option 2: Manual installation
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### Usage

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Basic usage (headed mode - you'll see the browser)
python -m src.cli scrape

# Headless mode (no browser window)
python -m src.cli scrape --headless

# Custom output
python -m src.cli scrape --output my_roadmap.csv

# Slower delays (more conservative)
python -m src.cli scrape --delay-ms 1000

# Full options
python -m src.cli scrape --help
```

## Key Features

### Robustness

- **Selector fallback chain** - tries multiple selectors to find nodes
- **Scroll sweep** - full-page scrolling to catch virtualized content
- **Geometry-based hierarchy** - infers structure from visual layout
- **Graceful error handling** - continues on individual failures
- **Partial results** - saves CSV even if some nodes fail

### User Experience

- **Progress logging** - see extraction in real-time
- **Success rate reporting** - know how complete your data is
- **Headed mode default** - watch the extraction happen
- **Configurable delays** - adjust for network/site speed

### Data Quality

- **Hierarchical structure** - maintains category relationships
- **UTF-8 encoding** - handles special characters
- **Clean CSV format** - proper quoting and escaping
- **Pipe-separated URLs** - easy to parse resources

## Testing

See `TESTING.md` for complete testing instructions.

**Quick smoke test:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m src.cli scrape --verbose
# Press Ctrl+C after 3-5 nodes to test partial results
```

**Full test:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m src.cli scrape
# Takes ~5-10 minutes, generates CSV in output/
```

## Output Example

```csv
Category,Subcategory,Topic,Description,Resources
"Engineering Management","Team Building","Building High-Performing Teams","Learn how to create and maintain effective teams","https://example.com/teams|https://example.com/performance"
"Engineering Management","Technical Leadership","Architecture Design","Understanding system architecture and design patterns","https://example.com/arch|https://example.com/patterns"
```

## Architecture Highlights

### 1. Modular Design

Each component (browser, nodes, drawer, export) is independent and testable.

### 2. Resilient Selectors

Multiple selector strategies ensure compatibility with site changes.

### 3. Geometry-Based Hierarchy

Uses bounding boxes to infer structure, more robust than DOM traversal.

### 4. Graceful Degradation

Continues processing even when individual nodes fail.

### 5. Detailed Logging

Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Documentation

- **User Documentation**: `README.md`
- **Testing Guide**: `TESTING.md`
- **Product Requirements**: `docs/product-requirements.md`
- **Technical Design**: `docs/technical-design.md`
- **Architecture Decisions**: `docs/architecture-decisions.md`

## Next Steps

### Ready to Use

The tool is production-ready for extracting the engineering manager roadmap.

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

- Google Sheets integration
- Multiple roadmap support (frontend, backend, DevOps)
- Async/parallel processing
- Resume from checkpoint
- Configuration file support

### Contributing

To modify or extend the tool:

1. Review `docs/technical-design.md` for architecture
2. Review `docs/architecture-decisions.md` for design rationale
3. Make changes in appropriate module
4. Test with `TESTING.md` checklist

## Dependencies

- **playwright** (1.40.0) - Browser automation
- **click** (8.1.7) - CLI framework
- **pandas** (2.1.4) - CSV export

All dependencies are pinned for reproducibility.
